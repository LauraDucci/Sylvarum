          <h2>WE HAVE A PROBLEM</h2>
          <p>
            By 2050, the world population will reach 9.5 billion people and food
            production will need to increase by 70% to ensure its survival. Not
            only are we not prepared to face such a scenario, but we have as our
            starting point an already obsolete food production system.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of vegetable cultivation, thousands of kilometers separate
            producers from costumers, which forces the use of long-distance
            means of transport, making the product more expensive and generating
            emissions. This, added to the intensive use of pesticides, has a
            negative impact on the environment. About half of the total
            production is lost during this process, due to external factors such
            as frosts or droughts, also in harvest, transport and even at the
            store shelf waiting to be bought.
          </p>
          <p>
            The limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have aggravated
            those weaknesses dramatically. Incalculable tons were lost due to
            the inability of harvesters to travel, supply chains were cut off,
            and many countries lost the access to import or export their
            products.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we add global warming and exponential population growth to all
            this, the situation becomes similar to having a time bomb in our
            hands. Sustainable and resilient plant production systems need to be
            developed.

          <h2>WHAT'S HAPPENING SO FAR</h2>
          <p>
            With all this into account, hydroponic farming is a very attractive
            alternative to standard methods. It is used to grow plants using
            mineral solutions instead of agricultural soil. This industry has
            multiple advantages:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              It is a system that can be installed in cities, avoiding the
              long-distance transport of fresh products which provides
              predictability.
            </li>
            <li>
              It maximizes the efficiency of resources, such as water and space.
            </li>
            <li>
              The quality of its products is superior compared to soil crops,
              from a nutritional point of view, appearance, cleanliness and,
              above all, duration.
            </li>
            <li>
              The use of greenhouses and shades allows to produce in all types
              of landscape, climates and times of the year, being able to
              federalize the production of this type of food.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is a highly environmentally friendly, it does not use
              herbicides or pesticides, reducing environmental pollution.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These factors make hydroponics an attractive, functional and
            sustainable option but, being a developing market, it is not fully
            exploited technologically.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are important improvement opportunities that need to become
            true in order to stablish hydroponic farming at the industrial
            field. It is exactly there where Sylvarum introduces itself as a
            technology whose action will change the game rules on big scales
            productions.

          <h2>FASTER, BETTER, FASTER, STRONGER</h2>

          <p>
            With the fusion of hydroponics and electroculture, Sylvarum proposes
            to use biophysical stimuli to hack into the crops metabolic system
            and thus increase their yield. By exposing the plant to certain
            electric and magnetic fields, we can control the exchange of ions
            with the aquatic growth medium, stimulating its nutritional capacity
            and accelerating its growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, this technology can be complemented with the three most
            developed branches of industrial improvements: energy optimization
            by the light source, artificial intelligence applied to the
            greenhouse conditions, and robotic automation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This advance is expected to considerably reduce time until harvest,
            increasing the number of growing cycles and reducing costs for
            producers, especially in energy and equipment depreciation, meaning
            a significant improvement in the profitability of this agricultural
            system. Following the rise of this market, Sylvarum seeks to add a
            new concept to production, through the implementation of
            cutting-edge technology.
